The Learnivo platform supports integrations with major payment gateways such as Stripe and PayPal,
allowing seamless transaction processing for your SaaS application.
Additionally, the system provides webhook support to
automate workflows based on payment events [Sources: webhook_reference.md, integrations_guide.md].

Example 2 (only one source):
To integrate Learnivo with your existing CRM, you need to first create an API key in the Learnivo dashboard.
Then, configure your CRM to use this API key to authenticate requests. Finally, set up webhook listeners to
